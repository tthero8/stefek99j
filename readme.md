# Google API Demo Tutorial

This is the code that accompanies the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFpMTdy0ogU

## Requirements
* Git
* Node + npm
* Google account
* Text editor (I use Sublime)
* Browser (I use Chrome)

*(I'm 99% sure you have these already)*

## Instalation
```
git clone git@github.com:stefek99/google-API-demo-tutorial.git
cd google-API-demo-tutorial
npm install
node app.js
open http://localhost:3000
```

## Philosophy
I've spent some time investigating all the login options. It wasn't that hard but it wasn't that easy either. One of the many reasons - none of the resources covered the process from the very beginning.

## Security
Be mindful with your secrets, be mindful with your tokens! I've already revoked and removed mine. Just saying... Don't ever expose them and maybe use a pattern - store credentials in a separate file that is in ```.gitignore```
